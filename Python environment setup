1) Creat new environment on Anaconda for Python 2.7
2) Install all the dependent libraries :

      !pip install secretsharing
      !pip install jsonpickle
      !pip install Crypto
      !pip install pycrypto
      !pip install argon2_cffi
      !pip install passlib
      import secretsharing as sss
      import jsonpickle # install via  "$ sudo pip install -U jsonpickle"
      from passlib.hash import pbkdf2_sha256,argon2,sha512_crypt,sha1_crypt
      from hashlib import sha256
      import base64
      from Crypto.Cipher import AES
      from Crypto import Random
      import os
      
      However it didn't work for some reason.
      
      
      Then used Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pBjpNr-XeUCm8me-izWukdrbd1PdgQ-K#scrollTo=3bYwt8MgimCa
      as an online python notebook 
      Installed all the above pre-requisites on this notebook.
